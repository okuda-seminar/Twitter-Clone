# Twitter-Clone (WIP)
This README lists up things to note for our efficient development.

## Offline Activity / MTG
- Utilize offline activities while repeatedly asking questions.

## PR / Review
- Confirm reviewer's avilable time before sending PR.
- Everyone in this project needs to merge at least 1 PR per week to continue to join.
- Align your commit title with your PR title. This means you should create only 1 commit for each PR.
- Amend your commit to reflect reviewer's comments.
- Do not recreate the same PR, but push with the force option to update your feature branch.
- Resolve conversations after modifying your code. Before requesting review again, all comments should be resolved or replied.
