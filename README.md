# Twitter-Clone (WIP)
This README lists up things to note for our efficient development.

## Offline Activity / MTG
- Utilize offline activities. You can repeatedly ask questions only on Saturday.
- Tasks by the next week should be determined by the end of each offline activity day.

## Development
- Add prefix like `[iOS]` for each commit / issue / PR.
- Add TODO for showing your understanding. This can save reviewer's time.
- TODO should be like: `// TODO: GITHUB_ISSUE_LINK - GITHUB_ISSUE_TITLE.` [examples](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aokuda-seminar%2FTwitter-Clone%20TODO&type=code)
- Push development branch for your reference if needed (but only 1 development branch should be pushed. Otherwise, a lot of development branches will be listed on GitHub and things can be easily messed up). If you have difficulty in resolving rebase conflicts, you can create a new feature branch and check your development branch on GitHub. This will help you copy and paste your code in the new feature branch. After that, you can update your remote feature branch with your new local one. Please do not forget adding your username as a prefix of your development branch like: `ryuji0123_development`

## PR / Review
- Use useful tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grammaly to correct / improve your comments. Especially, correcting your grammar should not take reviewer's time.
- Confirm reviewer's avilable time before sending PR.
- Everyone in this project needs to merge at least 1 PR per week to continue to join.
- Align your commit title with your PR title. This means you should create only 1 commit for each PR.
- Amend your commit to reflect reviewer's comments.
- Do not recreate the same PR, but push with the force option to update your feature branch.
- Resolve conversations after modifying your code. Before requesting review again, all comments should be resolved or replied.

## TL
- Take responsibility for making progress.
- Need to create sample code for other engs to reuse.
- Start assigning very easy tasks to others. Even with such tasks, they need to get familiar with code base and have difficulty in understanding team development cycle.
